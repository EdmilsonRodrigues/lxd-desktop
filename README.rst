LXD Desktop
===========

Welcome to **LXD Desktop**, an open-source project dedicated to making System Containers more accessible!

---

Why LXD Desktop?
----------------

In the evolving landscape of technology, the demand for computing resources has continuously outpaced the availability of hardware. This challenge led to the rise of **virtualization**, with Virtual Machines (VMs) and Application Containers (like Docker) becoming popular solutions. These technologies often come with user-friendly graphical interfaces (GUIs), such as Oracle VirtualBox for VMs and Docker Desktop for application containers, which significantly lower the barrier to entry for new users.

However, **System Containers**, while offering the power and breadth of VMs without the overhead of kernel and hardware virtualization, often remain overlooked. Linux Containers (LXC) are a prime example, allowing users to run VM-like environments by reusing the host's kernel, saving space, memory, and processing power. `Canonical's LXD`_  is the most prominent implementation of LXC.

Unlike VMs and application containers, system containers currently lack a widely adopted friendly GUI. This means that to use LXD, users typically need to be comfortable with the Linux terminal, understand networking concepts, and be able to create complex YAML configuration files â€“ all of which can be intimidating for newcomers. (LXD actually has a very nice network interface).

**LXD Desktop aims to bridge this gap.** Our mission is to create an intuitive graphical interface for managing LXD instances. This will empower users to easily manage their system containers in a user-friendly environment, making it easier for them to adopt and utilize this powerful technology.

---

How it Works
------------

LXD Desktop is built with a focus on ease of use and accessibility. We are developing a graphical interface using **Python**, and **PySide6**, and designed using **QML (Qt Markup Language)**.

This combination allows us to create a responsive, modern, and easy-to-navigate interface that simplifies the management of LXD instances.
